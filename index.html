              <p>Our data project, titled Community Investment Service Location, was created with the purpose of informing community members about the services offered at their communities. Many community members, for example the ones here in Watts, are unaware of the resources offered to them which prevents the community from enhancing . Thanks to the creation of  this website any individual who acquires connection to wifi will be allowed to navigate the website and inform themselves of the service locations that exist for them. Also, a very positive thing about this website is the fact that you don’t have to travel a long distance and waist your time to search for service. With this website you are able to figure out if the facility is operating. The website offers the name of the facility, the contact information,  the facility’s operating hours, as well as the address.  Overall the La Data Project titled Community Investment Service Location  is a new and economical way of maintaining the community informed of the service that is offered to them. This will not only unite community members but will also assure the enhancement of  the Los Angeles Community, who for long periods of time have been excluded from the benefits offered to communities to all community members.
